The corrected `app.json` or `app.config.js` file should have the correct paths, dependencies and proper JSON syntax.  For instance, if you were experiencing issues with an image path, ensure the path in your `app.json` is correct and that the image file exists in the specified location.  Double check that all your dependencies are correctly specified in your `package.json` and correctly imported.  If you find any syntax errors, fix them to ensure the JSON is valid.
